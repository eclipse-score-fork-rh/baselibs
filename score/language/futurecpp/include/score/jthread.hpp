/// \brief Represents a single thread of execution.
///
/// An implementation of the C++20 standard library class std::jthread based on Pthreads for use on POSIX operating
/// systems.
///
/// The class jthread represents a single thread of execution. It has the same general behavior as std::thread, except
/// that jthread automatically rejoins on destruction, and can be cancelled/stopped in certain situations.
///
/// Threads begin execution immediately upon construction of the associated thread object (pending any OS scheduling
/// delays), starting at the top-level function provided as a constructor argument. The return value of the top-level
/// function is ignored and if it terminates by throwing an exception, std::terminate is called. The top-level function
/// may communicate its return value or an exception to the caller via std::promise or by modifying shared variables
/// (which may require synchronization, see std::mutex and std::atomic)
///
/// Unlike std::thread, the jthread logically holds an internal private member of type score::cpp::stop_source, which maintains
/// a shared stop-state. The jthread constructor accepts a function that takes a score::cpp::stop_token as its first argument,
/// which will be passed in by the jthread from its internal stop_source. This allows the function to check if stop has
/// been requested during its execution, and return if it has.
///
/// score::cpp::jthread objects may also be in the state that does not represent any thread (after default construction, move
/// from, detach, or join), and a thread of execution may be not associated with any jthread objects (after detach).
///
/// No two score::cpp::jthread objects may represent the same thread of execution; score::cpp::jthread is not CopyConstructible or
/// CopyAssignable, although it is MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable.
