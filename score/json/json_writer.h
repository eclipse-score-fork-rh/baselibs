    /** @brief There are two usage modes: kUnsynced (default) updates the files directly,
     *         whereas kSynced will create a temporary file first, what guarantees
     *         that either the file will be completely replaced with the new contents
     *         or no changes will be seen if the operation fails or is interrupted
     *         (say, due to a power loss). Therefore, this mode is also referred to as
     *         `Atomic Update`.
     *
     *  When using the kSynced option, if the process creating the temporary file
     *  does not have the same UID/GID of the original file, one could end up with
     *  a different ownership for the resulting file.
     *  To avoid that, there's the extra parameter `ownership`,
     *  that can be set to specify what properties have to be kept.
     *
     *  Notice that changing the UID of the temporary file to reflect the one from
     *  the original file would require the process to have the privilege of executing
     *  chown operations. As that's usually not the case, it's advised that, if the
     *  user has this use-case where the ownership will differ, then all processes
     *  involved into updating the file shall share the same extra group, and the
     *  ownerhip flag should be set as `kUseCurrentProcessUID | kUseTargetFileGID`,
     *  such that even if there would be different UIDs, all processes
     *  could still access the file through the shared group.
     *
     *  The `ownership` parameter is ignored when kUnsynced mode is used.
     *
     *  @param file_sync_mode: Determines the synchronization mode (see above).
     *  @param ownership: When using kSynced mode, determines how to adjust the ownership
     *                    of the temporary file created.
